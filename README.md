AirCanvas â€“ Gesture-Based Drawing Using Python and OpenCV
AirCanvas is an interactive computer vision project that enables users to draw in mid-air using hand gestures tracked via webcam. Designed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, this project demonstrates real-time gesture recognition and dynamic virtual drawing without any physical contact.

âœ… What It Does
Tracks your index finger in real-time using webcam input

Allows you to draw on a virtual canvas just by moving your hand

Lets you switch colors by hovering over color boxes on screen

Clears the canvas with a specific hand gesture

Blends live video with a dynamic drawing overlay

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python â€“ Backend logic

OpenCV â€“ Frame capturing and image processing

MediaPipe â€“ Real-time hand landmark detection

NumPy â€“ Canvas operations and masking
