AirCanvas â€“ Gesture-Based Drawing Using Python and OpenCV
          
AirCanvas is an interactive computer vision project that enables users to draw in mid-air using hand gestures tracked via webcam. Designed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, this project demonstrates real-time gesture recognition and dynamic virtual drawing without any physical contact.
